# Computer Vision Project Directory

This directory is a collection of computer vision projects developed by me, Carlos Eduardo Fontaneli, during my studies. The goal is to showcase my skills and knowledge in image processing, shape recognition, and other computer vision techniques. Each project in this repository demonstrates a different aspect of computer vision and its applications.

## Projects

### 1. Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV

**Course Project:** This project is part of the "Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV" course I completed. It focuses on applying computer vision techniques to recognize shapes in digital images using OpenCV.

- **Skills Demonstrated:** Image processing, edge detection, Hough transforms, shape recognition.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Loading and displaying digital images.
  - Computing image gradients to highlight edges.
  - Detecting edges using the Canny edge detector.
  - Recognizing lines and circles in images using Hough transforms.
