# TensorFlow for Convolutional Neural Networks - Guided Project

This repository contains my guided project for the "TensorFlow for Convolutional Neural Networks" series. This project is an extension of the material covered in the second course of the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate. It aims to reinforce my skills and build more projects with TensorFlow, focusing on the practical application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.

## About the Project

In this 2-hour long project-based course, I delved into the fundamentals of CNNs, understanding their structure, components, and functionality. The project guided me through the process of solving a real-world image classification task using TensorFlow. Key achievements include:

- Learning the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks.
- Creating, training, and testing a neural network using real-world images.
- Gaining hands-on experience with TensorFlow for deep learning tasks.
- Implementing a bonus deep learning exercise with TensorFlow.

This project is designed for learners who are interested in working with CNNs and using Python and TensorFlow for building and training these networks. It is particularly beneficial for those who have completed a basic deep learning course and are looking for a practical project to enhance their skills and portfolio.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the project, I followed a step-by-step approach with the guidance of an instructor, covering the following key steps:

1. **Introduction and Overview of the Project:** Understanding the objectives and scope of the project.
2. **Understand the Structure of Neural Networks:** Exploring the architecture of neural networks and how they function.
3. **Components of Convolutional Neural Networks:** Learning about the various components that make up CNNs.
4. **Import the Dataset and Preprocess the Data:** Handling real-world image data and preparing it for training.
5. **Create and Train the Model:** Building a CNN model and training it on the dataset.
6. **Test the Model and Make Predictions:** Evaluating the model's performance and making predictions on new data.
