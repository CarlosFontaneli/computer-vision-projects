# Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV - Personal Project

## Overview

This repository contains my personal project for the "Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV" course. The project is focused on applying computer vision techniques to recognize shapes in digital images. Throughout the course, I learned how to process images using OpenCV and detect various shapes using Hough transforms.

## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes

The course was structured around five key learning objectives:

1. **Loading an Image from File:** I learned how to load and display digital images using OpenCV.
2. **Computing Image Gradients:** I explored how to compute image gradients to highlight edges and contours in the image.
3. **Detecting Edges in an Image:** I applied edge detection techniques, such as the Canny edge detector, to identify the boundaries of objects in the image.
4. **Recognizing Lines in an Image:** Using Hough transforms, I was able to detect and visualize lines present in the image.
5. **Recognizing Circles in an Image:** I further extended the use of Hough transforms to detect circles within the image.
